                 For a memorable meal the quality of the service is something that guests often remember as much as the food and drink served.
                 That means that restaurant servers must show extensive knowledge of all
                  types of cuisine and dishes, especially the ingredients and cooking style
                  of the dishes on an a la carte menu. They will need to know and understand
                  the methods of preparation and serving, along with the tools used.
                  Regardless of whether it is a self-service cafeteria or
                  a five star hotel restaurant good manners, a smart appearance,
                  and impeccable personal hygiene are equally essential.
